## Introduction

Code reviews are a systematic examination of code changes to improve code quality, share knowledge, and ensure consistency across the codebase. This guide provides best practices for both reviewers and authors.

## Code Review Principles

### Core Values
1. **Respect** - Treat all code and comments with respect
2. **Constructive** - Focus on improvement, not criticism
3. **Educational** - Use reviews as learning opportunities
4. **Timely** - Review code promptly to maintain momentum

### Goals
- Catch bugs early
- Ensure code quality
- Share knowledge
- Maintain consistency
- Improve team collaboration

## What to Look For

### 1. Code Quality
- Clean and readable code
- Proper naming conventions
- Code organization
- Documentation quality
- Test coverage

### 2. Functionality
- Correctness
- Edge cases
- Error handling
- Performance considerations
- Security implications

### 3. Design
- SOLID principles
- Design patterns
- Architecture consistency
- Code reusability
- Maintainability

### 4. Testing
- Test coverage
- Test quality
- Edge cases covered
- Integration tests
- Performance tests

## How to Give Feedback

### Do's
```markdown
✅ Be specific and actionable
✅ Explain the reasoning
✅ Provide examples
✅ Use a friendly tone
✅ Acknowledge good practices

// Good feedback example
"Consider extracting this validation logic into a separate method to improve reusability and make the code more maintainable. Here's an example:
```java
private boolean isValidUser(User user) {
    return user != null && user.getName() != null && !user.getName().isEmpty();
}
```"
```

### Don'ts
```markdown
❌ Make personal comments
❌ Be vague
❌ Be condescending
❌ Nitpick unnecessarily
❌ Rewrite code without explanation

// Bad feedback example
"This code is messy. Fix it."
```

## How to Receive Feedback

### Best Practices
1. **Be Open-minded**
   - Consider all feedback objectively
   - Don't take criticism personally
   - View feedback as learning opportunities

2. **Ask Questions**
   - Seek clarification when needed
   - Understand the reasoning
   - Discuss alternatives

3. **Respond Promptly**
   - Acknowledge feedback
   - Address all comments
   - Update code timely
