# Object-Oriented Programming Basics 🎯

This section covers the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that form the foundation of Low Level Design.

## 📋 Topics Covered

1. [Classes & Objects](classes-and-objects.md)
   - Building blocks of OOP
   - State and behavior
   - Object lifecycle

2. [Inheritance](inheritance.md)
   - Types of inheritance
   - Method overriding
   - Base and derived classes

3. [Polymorphism](polymorphism.md)
   - Compile-time polymorphism
   - Runtime polymorphism
   - Method overloading vs overriding

4. [Encapsulation](encapsulation.md)
   - Data hiding
   - Access modifiers
   - Getters and setters

5. [Abstraction](abstraction.md)
   - Abstract classes
   - Implementation hiding
   - Levels of abstraction

6. [Interfaces](interfaces.md)
   - Contract definition
   - Multiple inheritance
   - Default methods

7. [Abstract Classes](abstract-classes.md)
   - Partial implementation
   - Template patterns
   - When to use abstract classes

8. [Relationships](relationships.md)
   - Association
   - Aggregation
   - Composition
   - Dependency

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you should be able to:

- Understand core OOP concepts and their importance
- Implement classes and objects effectively
- Choose appropriate relationships between classes
- Apply inheritance and polymorphism correctly
- Design with abstraction and encapsulation in mind
- Know when to use interfaces vs abstract classes

## 📚 Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge
- Understanding of functions and variables
- Familiarity with any programming language

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Start with [Classes & Objects](classes-and-objects.md)
2. Follow the topics in order
3. Complete the exercises in each section
4. Review the interview questions
5. Practice with real-world examples

## 📝 Practice Tips

- Implement each concept in your preferred language
- Create small projects using these concepts
- Draw class diagrams for better understanding
- Review and refactor your code regularly
- Discuss and explain concepts to others
